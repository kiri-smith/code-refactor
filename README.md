# code-refactor

In this project I refactored a website to meet accessibility standards, without changing the overall look or content of the website. I had to research accessibility standards to determine what is necessary to improve accessibility, review the code already in place, and then make appropriate changes. Lastly, I deployed the site using GitHub in order to be accessed using the link provided below.
