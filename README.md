# code-refactor

In this project, I refactored a website to meet accessibility standards, without changing the overall look or content of the website. I first researched accessibility standards to determine what is necessary to improve accessibility. I then reviewed the initial code and updated HTML elements to semantic HTML elements. I ensured HTML elements followed a logical structure. I also added alt attributes to the images provided for accessibility purposes. I followed a similar process to update the CSS file to consolidate and re-organize the styling content based on the semantic structure. Lastly, I deployed the updated site using GitHub, to be accessed using the link provided in the appropriate section below.
